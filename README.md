# Huge mess aka playground for Arduino linerider
This is a project to get a "car" follow a line on the ground using photoresistors.  
Aka a line rider.  

Currently neither of the `cpp` files are "main" - they're all just sketches.  
Each sketch was to test some component seperately.  
E.g. servo motors, photoresistors, generic motors.  

If you want to see something that looks main'ish, look at `index.2.cpp`.  

# Beware
This is a very unmaintained repository, I just need to share snippets with other people - so I decided to make it public.
